# MII DIC reference model (DIC-RM) including IHE-QRPH profiles
This repository contains the DIC-RM modeled in 3LGM² extended with IHE profiles from the QRPH domain.
The DIC-RM is a supplementary material of a submission to the [EFMI Special Topics Conference 2023](https://www.stc2023.org/).

To view/edit the model file, the freely available 3LGM² tool ([https://www.3lgm2.de/](https://www.3lgm2.de/)) is required. If you want to have a look at the model graphics first, you can do this in the [Repo-Wiki](https://github.com/IMISE/IHE-QRPH/wiki) without using the 3LGM² tool.

For questions, comments or additions, please create an [Issue](https://github.com/IMISE/IHE-QRPH/issues).
